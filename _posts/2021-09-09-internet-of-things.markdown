A few years ago, concepts such as smart TVs, smart homes, and smart cities were unknown. Today, they have become a reality due to the advent of ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT). Gone are the days of mobile phones, laptops, and iPads for communicating and sharing data using the internet. Today, ‘Internet of Things’ has made it possible even for physical objects to interact and share data.

‘Internet of things’ or IoT is a system of interconnected devices or ‘things’ that can interact, collect, and share data through the internet. These ‘things’ can be your air conditioner, security camera, refrigerator, fitness band, or any physical object. When connected over the internet, these devices communicate, collect, and transfer data without human intervention. This data is then analysed to gain meaningful insights and initiate further actions as required.

A smart security camera, for instance, uses an IoT platform to monitor any activity in and around your house. The camera is connected to the internet, and monitoring is done using an app on your phone. Such cameras can recognise the difference between the resident, pet, or visitor. Whenever the camera identifies any suspicious activity, an alert is triggered on the app for the user to initiate the required action. Thus, a smart security camera built on the IoT concept is beneficial from a security perspective.

Some of the benefits of IoT are:
- Increased efficiency and productivity
- Improved usage of resources
- Reduced cost

1. **Things**: Things are physical objects with embedded sensors. These sensors detect and measure any changes in the environment, such as changes in temperature, humidity, pressure, and so on. For example, a sensor in a security camera checks the movement in a house. The collected data is then sent to the gateway.
2.	**Gateway**: Gateway is a bridge between objects and the cloud. It is a hardware device that collects data from the objects, processes it, and sends it to the cloud. Objects connect to the gateway through wireless transmission modes such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, and so on.
3.	**Cloud**: Cloud is a massive collection of interconnected servers that stores and processes data received from the gateway. This is where the data is analysed, and inferences are drawn. For example, the data received from the security camera sensor is checked to identify objects such as intruders in the house.
4.	**Application**: The application is installed on the user’s phone, iPad, or computer. It receives the data processed in the cloud. Sometimes, the application sends a notification to alert the user if the processed data identify an intruder in the house.

One of the latest tools built on IoT is the covid wristbands used in countries like Hong Kong. These wristbands track the movement of people under compulsory home quarantine using a mobile application. If someone tries to escape the quarantine, concerned officials are automatically intimated about the same. Thus, covid wristbands using the IoT concept have saved government resources to curb the spread of coronavirus.

Although IoT is beneficial, there are a few limitations to it.
- Concern about data security
- Dependency on internet connectivity
- Complexity of underlying systems

The application of IoT is not only limited to homes and communities. IoT platform is adopted by various industries such as manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, and so on. The number of IoT connected things is growing every year. According to International Data Corporation (IDC)  , the number is expected to reach 41.6 billion by 2025. As per Gartner , the enterprise IoT platform market will grow close to $7.6 billion by 2024. IoT is the backbone of the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0 . With technological advances such as 5G technology  and edge computing , IoT will continue to evolve in the coming years.
