A mobile phone is a portable, wireless telephone which is used for communication. It can be easily carried in a pocket. When the mobile phones were first introduced, their only use was to make and receive calls. However, the modern mobile phones can be used to send text messages, emails, photos, videos as well as browse through the internet, listen to music, play games and can have many such other advanced features.

Mobile phones use radio waves to communicate over a cellular network.  A cellular network is an interconnected network of cells. A cell is a hexagonal area of land and is equipped with its own transmitter-receiver tower, also called as “Base station”.

Whenever the sender makes a call, the phone converts his voice into electrical signal which in turn is converted into radio waves and these are transmitted to the nearest base station. This base station will direct the signal to the base station of the cell where the receiver is located. The base station will transmit the signal to the receiver. This received radio signal will then get converted back to voice signal by the receiver’s phone.

With the invention of mobile phones communication is not limited to homes. With the help of mobile phone, anyone can communicate while walking on the street, travelling in train or while sitting anywhere in the world. Moreover with the teleconferencing feature, the user can communicate with more than one person at the same time. It is a single device loaded with functionalities of many devices such as alarm clock, calculator, calendar, torch, camera, navigator, music player, radio, recorder etc. Apart from these default features, one can download many other features as “applications” from the internet for learning, entertainment, fitness and so on. However, on the other side all these features could become a major cause of distraction in people since so much information is available at the fingertips at all times. This may reduce the productivity of a person.

Though the world has become smaller with the fast communication avenues created by mobile phone, it can also make a person isolated from the immediate world around him with the lack of personal interaction. Moreover the radiation emitted by mobile phones can cause serious health issues when used over a prolong period of time. So, one must find the right balance by limiting its usage and being less dependent on it.
